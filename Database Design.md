## Database Design
* Schemas - how should data be logically organized
* Normalization - should my data have minimal dependency and redundancy
* Views - wht joins will be done most often
* Access control - should all users oif dB have same level of access
* DBMS - how do I pick between SQL and NoSQL options

### Approaches to Processing Data
1. OLTP vs OLAP
* OLTP data is stored in an Operational Database, which is pulled and cleaned to create an OLAP Data Warehouse
