# Cloud Computing

#### Scalability in Cloud
* Cloud Computing allows you to easily add and remove resources as you need them
* There are two types of scaling:
    * Vertical scaling allows you to change the power of your existing instance. You could get a more powerful server for example
    * With horizontal scaling, you are simply increasing the number of instances you're using, sharing the workload across multiple devices
