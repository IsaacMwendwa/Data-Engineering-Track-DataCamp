# Cloud Computing

#### Scalability in Cloud
* Cloud Computing allows you to easily add and remove resources as you need them
* There are two types of scaling:
    * Vertical scaling allows you to change the power of your existing instance. You could get a more powerful server for example
    * With horizontal scaling, you are simply increasing the number of instances you're using, sharing the workload across multiple devices

### Cloud Services Models
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - offers cloud infrastructure
* Platform as a Service (PaaS) - offers infrastructure and software for application development
* Software as a Service (SaaS) - offers ready-to-use applications in the cloud

* FaaS (Function as a Service) is a variation on SaaS, except that now you're only concerned with a single function, or part of the software
* For example, you can run identity authentication, or payment transactions
* FaaS often uses a billing model called "serverless"
* This is slightly misleading because the computations are still run on a server - what it means is that you pay for the service rather than paying to rent servers.
