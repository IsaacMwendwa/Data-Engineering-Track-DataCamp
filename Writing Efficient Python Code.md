# Writing Efficient Python Code

## Introduction
* Efficient code refers to code that satisfies two key concepts
* First, efficient code is fast and has a small latency between execution and returning a result
* Second, efficient code allocates resources skillfully and isn't subjected to unnecessary overhead
* Although your definition of fast runtime and small memory usage may depend on the task at hand, the goal of writing efficient code is still to reduce both latency and overhead
* Pythonic code is code that follows the best practices and guiding principles of Python. Pythonic code tends to be less verbose and easier to interpret
* The Zen of Python is a list of a few idioms and best practices that summarize Python's design philosophy
