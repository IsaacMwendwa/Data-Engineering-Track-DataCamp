# Version Control in Git

## Introduction
* Version is the contents of a file at a given point in time. It also includes metadata, or information associated with the file, such as the author, where it is located, the file type, and when it was last saved
* Version control is a group of systems and processes to manage changes made to documents, programs, and directories
* Version control isn't just for software. Anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can benefit from using version control
* Version control allows us to track files in different states and let multiple people work on the same files simultaneously, a concept known as continuous development
* It also allows us to combine different versions, identify a particular version of a file, and revert changes
* One popular program for version control is called Git
* Git is open source and scalable to easily track everything from small solo projects to complex collaborative efforts with large teams!
* Note that Git is not the same as GitHub, which is a cloud-based Git repository hosting platform. However, it's common to use Git with GitHub
* A key benefit of Git is that it stores everything, so nothing is ever lost
* Also, Git automatically notifies us when our work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder to accidentally overwrite content
* Additionally, Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines.
